1. Key Directories
Directory	Meaning	Example / Notes
/	Root directory	Top-level directory, contains all system folders (bin, home, etc, usr, var, tmp)
/home	Parent directory for all users	Contains folders like /home/pramit18
/home/pramit18	Home directory (your personal workspace)	Equivalent of C:\Users\Pramit in Windows
.	Current directory	Always present, points to where you are now
..	Parent directory	Always present, points to one level up
2. Navigation Commands
pwd       # Show current directory
cd /      # Go to root directory
cd ~      # Go to home directory
cd ..     # Go to parent directory
ls        # List files/folders
ls -a     # List all files, including hidden (. and ..)
ls -la    # Detailed listing with permissions, owners, sizes, etc.

3. Creating & Managing Files/Folders
mkdir folder_name        # Create directory
rmdir folder_name        # Remove empty directory
touch file_name.txt      # Create empty file
nano file_name.txt       # Open file to edit
cat file_name.txt        # Display file contents
head -n 5 file_name.txt  # Show first 5 lines
tail -n 5 file_name.txt  # Show last 5 lines
cp file1 file2           # Copy file
mv file1 folder/         # Move file or rename
rm file_name             # Remove file

4. File & Directory Permissions

Format: drwxr-x---

d â†’ directory (- = file)

First 3 (rwx) â†’ owner permissions

Next 3 (r-x) â†’ group permissions

Last 3 (---) â†’ othersâ€™ permissions

Examples:

drwxr-xr-x â†’ directory, owner can read/write/execute, group read/execute, others read/execute

-rw-r--r-- â†’ file, owner read/write, group read, others read

5. Users & Ownership
whoami          # Current user
id              # User ID and group info
ls -l           # Show owner & group of files/folders


Owner: user who created the file/folder

Group: users who share permissions

Others: everyone else

6. System Info
uname -a        # Kernel info
lsb_release -a  # OS version
df -h           # Disk usage
free -m         # Memory usage

7. Package Management (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update         # Update package lists
sudo apt upgrade -y     # Upgrade packages
sudo apt install tree -y # Install a package (tree)

8. Linux Practice Notes

Current Linux environment: WSL Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Practice flow:

Navigate directories (/, /home, /home/pramit18)

Explore ., .., and user directories

Create folders/files, copy/move/delete

Check and modify permissions

Learn system commands (uname, df, free)

Tip: Always use ls -la to see hidden files and permissions

9. Key Takeaways

. = current directory, .. = parent directory

d in permissions = directory, - = file

/home/pramit18 is your personal workspace

Linux commands are case-sensitive

Permissions control who can read/write/execute files
